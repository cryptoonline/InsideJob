Data Stealing Attacks:
The data stealing attack app need device specific code to parse the messages, therefore it has seperate code for all four devices we used in our study.

Data Injection Attacks:
The variables (e.g. Bluetooth MAC address of the device or pin code of the device) in data injection attack app varies depending upon on the device. So, these things need to be adjusted according to the devices in hand.
